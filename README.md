# PYpractice-HashForce
In order to practise my python skills, also as a CTF liker always used python to decode, so I made this module  
continue append more function as a exercise for coding with python  
class hashforce used to force hash string,it also have subclass md5force or crc32force.  
class dicforce can create dictionary, and use to brute force  
func addType can create your own encode func into class for decode  
func getType to get your func
